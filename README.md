# Dashboard-development-for-Real-Time-monitoring-of-reefer-container

**Objective** 

Objective of this project is to visualization of Real Time datas with the help of different charts and Monitor them and send Notification to user for Outlier Points

**How will it work ?**

Few sensors will be installed on a reefer container that is  going to be shipped and it will upload Temperature , Humidity, VOC & CO2 datas to cloud  every 3-4 seconds and our dashboard will fetch those datas, then show them in dashboard and plot them with the help of different charts as per users wish or convenience and keeping in mind a fact that user can not monitor data 24*7 . There is an Alert based System that will send Auto-generated Notification to user for each outlier points with proper discriptio about that point so that if there is any problem that can be fixed .

**This is How our Dashboard looks like**
